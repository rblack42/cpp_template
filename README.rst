..  image:: https://travis-ci.org/rblack42/cpp_template.svg?branch=master

This project is a template for C++ projects using Make, Catch, and Travis-CI.

iTo use this template:

    * clone to your local machine

    * Edit the ``Makefile`` and change the PROJDIR setting so it matches where
      you work on your machine.

    * run "make new-project" in the template repository

        * enter the name of your new project (with the ``PROJDIR`` directory

..  note::

    The name you provide should point to a new, empty project cloned from
    GitHUb_ for my classes. This will be set up for you ahead of time.

You can use this template to work on personal projects. The template will
create the project directory, but will not connect it to GitGub. YOu must do
that manually using the instructions shown on GitHUb when you crete a new
preopsitory.
